This is a student project we made as part of our education at Soy Henry, which consisted of creating a full-stack React application from scratch.

Our stack of technologies:
Front End:

HTML - CSS - Javascript
React
React-Bootstrap
Redux
Back End:

Node.js
Express
Passport
Sequelize
Database:

PostgreSQL


How to start the project:
If you want to see the page for yourself, you'll need to do the following:

Clone the repository
Create a .env file in the client folder with the following contents:

username: postgres
password: whateveryouwant

npm install in the api folder
npm install in the client folder

npm start. 

The page won't have products, you'll need to add them using a admin account. You can create an admin in the CRUD area.
